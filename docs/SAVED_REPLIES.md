# Saved Responses for the Issue Tracker in Angular

The following are canned responses that the Angular team should use to close issues on the Angular issue tracker that fall into the listed resolution categories.

Since GitHub currently does not allow the Angular team to have a repository-wide or organization-wide list of [saved replies](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-saved-replies/), these replies need to be maintained by individual team members.
Since the responses are able to be modified in the future, all responses are versioned to simplify the process of keeping the responses up to date.
