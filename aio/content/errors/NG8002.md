@shortDescription Unknown attribute or input

@description

An attribute or property is not able to be resolved during compilation.

This error arises when attempting to bind to a property that does not exist.
Any property binding must correspond to either:

*   A native property on the HTML element
*   An `@Input()` property of a component or directive applied to the element

The runtime error for this is

<code-example format="none" hideCopy language="none">

NG0304: '&dollar;{tagName}' is not a known element: &hellip;'

</code-example>

@debugging

Look at documentation for the specific [binding syntax](guide/binding-syntax "Binding syntax | Angular") used.
This is usually a typo or incorrect import.
There may also be a missing direction with property selector 'name' or missing input.
