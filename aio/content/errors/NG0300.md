@shortDescription Multiple components match with the same tagname

@description

Two or more components use the same [element selector](guide/component/component-create#specify-the-css-selector "Specify the CSS selector - Create an Angular component | Angular").
Because there is only be a single component associated with an element, selectors must be unique strings to prevent ambiguity for Angular.

@debugging

Use the element name from the error message to search for places where you are using the same [selector declaration](guide/architecture-components "Introduction to components and templates | Angular") in your codebase:

<code-example format="typescript" language="typescript">

&commat;Component({
  selector: 'YOUR_STRING',
  &hellip;
})

</code-example>

Ensure that each component has a unique CSS selector.
This will guarantee that Angular renders the component you expect.

If you are having trouble finding multiple components with this selector tag name, check for components from imported component libraries, such as Angular Material.
Make sure you are following the [best practices](guide/styleguide#component-selectors "Component selectors - Angular coding style guide | Angular") for your selectors to prevent collisions.
