<div class="section">
	<h2>@Optional() Component</h2>
	<p>This component still works even though the OptionalService (notice @Optional() in the consturctor is not provided or configured anywhere. Angular goes through tree and visibilty rules, and if it does not find the requested service, returns null.</p>
</div>
